#Ghibli Art Generator
The Ghibli Art Generator is my Major Academic Project.
It is built to improve my Backend Development skills and strengthen my understanding of DevOps practices.
This project contains a React frontend and a Java + Spring Boot backend, both structured as Microservices and fully containerized.

#Project Description
This project was created to learn and apply Docker, Kubernetes, and Microservices Architecture in a real development workflow.
The application generates Ghibli-style art using either an uploaded image or a text input.
To keep the architecture modular, I created three separate Docker images.
